## Project Overview  
This program is a list generator that makes full use of the capabilities of the range function. The users input the number they want their list to start at, the number they want it to end at and how it should be incremented or decremented. The program makes use of a for loop, input statements and the range function.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. An area of improvement would be to find a way to handle floating point numbers either by telling the users the program can't generate a list of decimals or add the feature that allows the program to create a list for floating point numbers.  
2. Another area of improvement would be to find out if there is a way to handle the incrementing or decrementing values better to ensure there are no clashes and the user fully understand what it does and how to use them properly.
