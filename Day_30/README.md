## Project Overview  
This program is more or less like a questionnaire asking for a review on the past 30 days of 100 days of code. It asks the user to describe each day in one word and prints out a sentence expanciating what the user thought each day was like. It makes use of a for loop to run the program 30 times and an f-string to concatenate variables to strings and change the alignment of the final review being printed out to the screen.  

## Areas of Improvement  
The only area of improvement I can think of is adding emojis but it would be difficult since you would need an emoji that would go for every feeling either good or bad.
