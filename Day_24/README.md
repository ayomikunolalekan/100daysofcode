## Project Overview  
This program is an infinity dice that rolls a random number based on the number of sides you decide it should have. The program makes use of a function rollDice which takes in the parameter sides and it also makes use of the random library to generate random integers between 1 and the number of sides filled in by the user.  

## Area of Improvement  
An area of improvement would be to create an exception where if the user is asked if they want to roll again and they input any other than yes or no, an exception is raised and they are asked the same question again until they answer yes to reroll the dice or no to end the program.
