## Project Overview  
This program is a basic login system where the username and password of the user has been hardcoded into the program. The program makes use of a subroutine/function to ask the user their name and password and successfully log the user in if it is correct or send a message to the user and ask them the question again if either their name or password is wrong.  
The subroutine is called after it's definition/creation to enable it perform its expected action.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. An area of improvement would be to create a count or number of tries variable that keeps track of how many times the user has tried to login and exits the program after a certain number of attempts and probably lock them out for a period. This will discourage individuals who are just trying to guess their way into the program.  
2. Another area of improvement would be to include a database so that we can have multiple users and perform the necessary checks from the database rather than hardcoding the user details into the main.py file.
