## Project Overview  
This program is the guess my number game from day 18 but with a little twist. In day 18, the secret number was hardcoded into the game leading to a scenario where the user would be unable to play the game again after correctly guessing the number but this updated version makes use of the random library and the randint method to generate random numbers and give the users the chance to guess a brand new number every time they play.  

## Areas of Improvement  
For this particular project, there really isn't an area of improvement but an idea to maybe give the game more twist is to devise a way to add floating point numbers as possible guessing numbers.
