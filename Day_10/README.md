## Project Overview  
This project is a bill calculator that takes the total amount of a bill, the tip percentage and the amount of people the bill is to be split among. It then returns the total bill per person. It makes use of operation symbols such as addition e.t.c. It also makes use of input statements, float and int function to convert strings to integers and floating point numbers respectively. If and elif statements are also used in the program as a fun way of just giving a different amount of people different responses.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. It would be nice to add an exception that triggers when the nnumber of individuals is 0 and for other cases so the program doesn't crash when for example the tip percent is a floation point number instead of an integer.  
2. Another area would be to find a way to differentiate between int and float in the billAmount. When the bill is an integer, whole number division should be done instead of regular division.
