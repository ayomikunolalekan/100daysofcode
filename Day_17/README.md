## Project Overview  
This project is upgrade on the rock, paper, scissors game from day 14. The program now makes use of a while loop to ensure that there is more than one round and the game only ends when a certain condition is met. This version of the game also keeps track of the player's scores and display it to them after every round and it makes use of an exit function to end the program when a certain player's score is up to three points.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. Using the .lowercase() or .upper() method for the inputs and remove the amount of or statements in the program.
