## Project Overview  
This project is an affirmation generator that makes use of the concepts of if, elif, else and nested if statements. It also makes use of the input and print statement.  
The user inputs their name and what day of the week it is and a positive affirmation is printed out to the user.  

## Areas of Improvement  
Areas of improvement could be to add specific affirmations for certain individuals while leaving the general affirmations for others. The concatenation could also be done better but that is a feature that'll change in my projects after learning f strings in python.
