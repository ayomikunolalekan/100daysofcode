## Project Overview  
This project/program is a generation finder/generator. It makes use of inequality operators, the int function to convert input strings to numbers. The user inputs the year they were born and they receive an output with the generation they belong to.  

## Areas of Improvement  
An area of improvement would be ensuring the start and end dates for each generation are accurate and updating it to follow with the times. The program stops at Generation Z but so far there has been two new generations and the program did not include them.
