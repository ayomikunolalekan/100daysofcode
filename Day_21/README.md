## Project Overview  
This program is a math facts game made specifically to test the multiplication skills of the users. It makes use of the for loop and the range function to run the program a certain amount of times. The user picks the number they want to be tested on and they are asked for the multiples of their selected number up till the twelfth multiple.  

## Areas of Improvement  
An area of improvement would be to improve the game so that it's not just multiplication tables the user is being asked, it could be other questions involving multiplication or other mathematical operations.
