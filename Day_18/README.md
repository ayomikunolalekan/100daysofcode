## Project Overview  
This project is a guess my number game where the user has to guess a secret number that falls within a certain range. The program makes use of a while loop to repeat the program until the user gets the number right, a counter to show the user their number of attempts at the end of the game and if, elif, and else statements to inform the user if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.  
Lastly, the program also makes use of an exit function to end the program if the user's guess is a negative number.  

## Areas of Improvement  
An area of improvement would be to make the secret number a random number instead of making it constant. That way users can play the game more than once.
