## Project Overview  
This program is a video game characters generator. It makes use of a function to ask the user the name of their character and their species, also a function that rolls a dice and calculates the health stat and strength stat of the character. It also makes use of a while loop, an os, time, and random library to perform certain operations.  

## Areas of Improvement  
An area of improvement would be to create a file for the functions to make the codebase look more organized.
