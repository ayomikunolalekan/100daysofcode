## Project Overview  
This project made use of if, elif, and else statements to give three different individuals a short personalized greeting and turn away anyone who does not identify as the three individuals either through their usernames or their passwords.  
This project was built as my 100 days of code day 6 task. Honestly looking forward to day 7.
