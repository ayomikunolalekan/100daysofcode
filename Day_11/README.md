## Project Overview  
This project does the simple task of calculating how many seconds are in a year based on if the year is a regular year or if it is a leap year. The program makes use of if and else statements, the input function to know what year it is from the user and mathematical operation symbols to perform the calculations.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. An area of improvement would be making variables such as secondsInAMinute and other variables excluding the year and final calculation results a constant as they are values that do not change or don't have a chance of changing anytime soon.
