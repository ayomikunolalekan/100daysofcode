## Project Overview  
This project is a two player rock, paper, scissors game that makes use of if, elif, else and nested if statements. It also makes use of input statements to collect the moves from the players and a line at the top that prevents each player from seeing what their opponent played.  

## Areas of Improvement  
1. The game is not continuous and there is only one round, we can make it continuous.
