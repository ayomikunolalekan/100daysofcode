## Project Overview  
This program is a music player that plays an audio based on an option selected by the user. It makes use of two functions pause and play, and a while loop to run the menu again based on if the user selects any other option or while the audio is playing, selects option 2. The two functions were provided by replit so I can't really give in depth about them. I also made use of the os library to clear previous code from the terminal and time library to pause execution for a second.  

## Area of Improvement  
The main area of improvement would be that the program should not crash when letters are input in instead it should most likely raise an exception and start the program again.
