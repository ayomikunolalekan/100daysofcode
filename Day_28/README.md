## Project Overview  
This program is a continuation of the character generator built in day 27. This program makes use of the characters created and makes them fight until one character emerges as the winner. The winner of the round is decided by the character with highest roll and the damage done is calculated using a formula given by replit based on the characters strength.  
The program also counts how many it takes before a character can emerge as the winner of the battle.

## Areas of Improvement  
A major area of improvement would be to create a separate file for the functions thereby improving code organization.
