## Project Overview  
This project is a gradebook or a grade generator. It makes use of int and float functions to convert input function values to numbers. It also makes use of if, elif and else statements to determine the user's grade based on a certain percentage range and mathematical operators to perform calculations.  
The user inputs the total score they could have gotten in a test and their score, based on those values, the program calculates their score percentage and uses the range of values to determine their grade.  

# Areas of Improvement  
1. The program could ask the user for the grading criteria instead of just using the hardcoded grading values or ranges to determine the user's grade. This would help out as grading varies by schools, regions and countries.
