## Project Overview  
This project is an animal sounds generator. The user puts in the animal they want to hear the sound of and they get a response from the program. The program makes use of a while loop to ensure that the program doesn't end after just one run and keeps running while the condition is met. I also made use of a .lower() method to convert inputs to lowercase therefore ensuring that no matter how the user gives their input, the program doesn't crash because it'll be converted to lowercase. 

## Areas of Improvement  
1. An area of improvement would be to widen the range of animal sounds available. Maybe store the animal and their sounds in a database or find a way to get a larger range instead of just five animals.
