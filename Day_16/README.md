## Project Overview  
This program is a "find the blank or missing lyric" game where users have to guess the missing word in the provided lyrics. It tests the user's musical knowledge. The program makes use of a while loop to repeat the program until the user guesses the correct lyric, a counter to show the users the amount of attempts they had before they could guess the lyric and an if and else statement to perform some actions based on if the user's guess is correct or wrong.  
The program also makes use of a break statement to leave the while loop when the user's guess is correct.  


## Areas of Improvement  
1. I can make use of a .lowercase() method to convert the user's guess regardless of it is capitalized or not to a lowercase format to ensure that all styles of inputs are accepted.
2. If possible, having more than one lyrics will make the game or program better as users would be able to make use of it multiple times.
